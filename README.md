# JoshBot
A small discord bot project to practice javascript using discord.js

 <br>
 
## Current Features
  **!github** sends a link to my repositories on this github profile

  **!help** displays a code block with the list of current commands and a small description of what they do

  **!ping** is a simple test command that will have the bot reply with "Pong" if the bot is working correctly.

  **!quote** uses Math.random to pick a random value and spit back the corresponding quote from the array

 ## Use
 Code is currently not able to be used as the bot token is not supplied in any file. Also please do not take the code for your own use.
